# Project 3 - Data Structure and Algorithms (1)

## Requirements
* Create 8 instances using the `Person` constructor by giving the names and ages of your choice
* Put them in an array
* Use your sort algorithm implemented in Project3 to sort the array
* Implement three search algorithms:
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search implemented with iterations
  * Binary Search implemented with recursive calls

### Create a Test program 
* Run the following search tests using the 3 search algorithms on the array of `Person`s respectively.
* Search Criteria:
  * Search an existing person with a given age.
  * Search an age that cannot be found.
* Print out the search results of two cases for all 3 search algorithms.

### Examples:
* Watch class video: 8-15
* There are examples in the video and Search the internet for more examples if needed.

## How to do it:
* This is a group project.
* Please form or join a group of 3-4 members.
* Please work together as a group but each member has to contribute.
* All code has to be compilable and tested.

## How to submit it:
* Create a `your_group_name/README.md` file for your group in [projects/project4](.). 
  * Note: `your_group_name` is your group name which should be different from others.
  * Write your group member's names and contributions in the `README.md` file and add any notes there if you have.
  * Then click the `Commit new file` button at the bottom.
  * Example: https://github.com/mkz100/CS1-Students/blob/master/projects/project2/my_group_name_sample/README.md
  * Follow steps here https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser
* Upload the source code files to the `your_group_name` folder
  * navigate to the `your_group_name` folder: click the `Add file` button -> `Upload files`
