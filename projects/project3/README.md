# Project 3 - Data Structure and Algorithms (1)

## Requirements
### Create a `Person` class
* Attributes:
  * name
  * age
    
* Constructor:
  * take in parameters to initialize the name and age

* Implement Methods:
  * getter methods for name and age
  * toString method to return the output in this format: {name: real_name, age: real_age}

* Implement the Comparable interface which compare the age. 

### Implement one of the sorting algorithm to sort the array of person(s)
* Choose and implement any sorting algorithm you like to sort the array of person(s) in order.
* Print the person instances in the sorted order. (toString method should be used to format the output)

### Create a Test program 
* Instantiate / create 5 instances using the Person constructor by giving the names and ages of your choice
* Put them in an array
* Use your sort algorithm to sort the array
* Print the array in sorted order

### Examples:
* Watch class videos: 8-3 to 8-7
* There are examples in the videos.

## How to do it:
* This is a group project.
* Please form or join a group of 3-4 members.
* Please work together as a group but each member has to contribute.
* All code has to be compilable and tested.

## How to submit it:
* Write your names in the comment of the Test java program.
* Create a folder for your group in [projects/project3](projects/project3)
* Submit the source code to the group folder.
